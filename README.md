## Code Refactor

This is the readme file for the HomeWork Assignment Week 1.  It is the first step to making me not only able to understand what the code says but it will give me insight into what the future code will look like.

Creating code that follows accesibility standards and is optimized for search engines

The assignment was to retain the look and feel of the example site but;

- 1 Use semantic HTML elements
- 2 Follow a logical Structure independent of styling and positioning.
- 3 Use alt attributes when viewing icon and image elements
- 4 Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- 5 The title element is concise and descriptive.

As the founder and owner of CAC By Design (Kitchen and Bath Remodeling), CLEAR Business Insight & Local Trusted Expert I found that there is no real standout software specifically designed to operate a small business.  Software designed for the Kitchen / Bath and Countertop industry has many specific challenges that when solved translate very well to almost every other small business in every industry.  I have spent the last 5 years working with programmers from around the world only to find that their lack of small business knowledge and structure prevents them from coding software to meet the needs of a small business.  Prior to starting CAC By Design I programmed in Basic, Visual Basic and several other hybrid launguages.  After starting to work with coding teams I quickly learn that they either lack the knowledge to execute the level of complexity CLEAR Business Insight needs or they lack the desire to stay focussed to get it done.  I have learned that there are dozens of ways to get a task done but each path a code writer takes has both advantages and disadvantages to future code that will need to be written. By learning code myself I will be able to keep the future in focus while creating the code for the present and to direct the team to do the same.
